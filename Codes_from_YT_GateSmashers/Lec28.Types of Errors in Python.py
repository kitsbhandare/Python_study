Types of Errors in Python
• Syntax errors: Syntax errors occur when the code violates the rules of the Python language syntax. These errors are detected by the Python
interpreter when it is parsing the code. (Missing colon, Unmatched parentheses, Missing quotes, Using a keyword as a variable name, Missing indentation)
• Runtime errors: Runtime errors occur when the code is syntactically correct but causes an error when it is executed. These errors can be caused by a
variety of reasons, such as invalid input data, division by zero, or accessing an undefined variable.
• Logical errors: Logical errors occur when the code is syntactically correct and runs without causing any errors, but the output is not what you
expected. These errors can be caused by incorrect algorithmic design, mathematical errors, or a misunderstanding of the problem requirements.
