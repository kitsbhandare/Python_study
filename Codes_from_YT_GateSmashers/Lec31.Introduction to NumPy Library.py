Introduction to NumPy
• NumPy stands for 'Numerical Python' powerful Python library that is widely used for scientific computing,
  data analysis, and numerical computing tasks.
• pip install NumPy
• In NumPy, an Array is the fundamental object.
• Arrays are used to store homogeneous data elements in a contiguous block of memory.

'''
Array vs List
• All elements of an array are of same data type.
• Elements of an array are stored in contiguous memory locations.
• Arrays are static and cannot be resized once they are created.
• Arrays support element wise operations.
• NumPy array takes up less space in memory.
• List can have elements of different data types.
• List elements are not stored contiguously in memory.
• Lists can be resized and modified easily.
• Lists do not support element wise operations.
• More space in memory
