Comparison Operators
â€¢ In Python, comparison operators are used to compare two values and return a
Boolean value (True or False) depending on the result of the comparison.
== Equal to:    Returns True if the values on either side of the operator are equal, and False otherwise.
!= Not equal to:    Returns True if the values on either side of the operator are not equal, and False otherwise.
> Greater than:    Returns True if the value on the left is greater than the value on the right, and False otherwise.
< Less than:     Returns True if the value on the left is less than the value on the right, and False otherwise.
>= Greater than or equal to:   Returns True if the value on the left is greater than or equal to the value on the right, and False otherwise.
<= Less than or equal to: R   eturns True if the value on the left is less than or equal to the value on the right, and False otherwise.
